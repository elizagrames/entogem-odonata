# EntoGEM: Odonata Supporting Information
This repository contains scripts to run topic models and subset the EntoGEM library of bibliographic records to only those on odonate with high predicted probability of inclusion. It also contains metadata for articles included at full text screening, schemes for reclassifying inconsistent metadata, and for reproducing plots from Grames et al. (2022).
